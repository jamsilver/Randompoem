In the night of my second despair

When the waters rose and the storm was there

And the pain became too great to bear

I knocked at the tomb, and no one was there. 

The first time I faced this, Jesus redeemed, 

The rescue for everything wrong it seemed

But the second time went on forever and ever

And ever and ever and... oh isn't this clever? 

Eventually the stench of the body seeps through

Under the rock that still seals his tomb

And you realise what they tell you ain't true. 

And somehow you find another way through.
